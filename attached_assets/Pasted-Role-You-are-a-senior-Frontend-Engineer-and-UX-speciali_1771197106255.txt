Role:
You are a senior Frontend Engineer and UX specialist polishing an already strong cybersecurity portfolio.

Important Rule:
❌ Do NOT redesign
❌ Do NOT remove or change any existing sections or content
❌ Do NOT add noise or flashy effects

✅ Only enhance UX, clarity, and visual strength
The site is already very good — your job is to make it feel premium and modern.

🎨 Sidebar Enhancements (Very Important)

Make the left sidebar slightly wider so it feels more solid and visible

Increase width subtly (not too much)

Adjust sidebar background to a slightly lighter green-tinted dark color

Must visually match the Contact Me button green

Keep icons and text exactly the same

Active section highlight should remain green, but feel clearer

⬆️ Scroll To Top Button

Add a floating scroll-to-top arrow

Color: Cyber Green (same accent used across the site)

Position: bottom-right

Behavior:

Appears after scrolling down

Smooth fade-in

Small, elegant animation (pulse or bounce — very subtle)

On click:

Smooth scroll back to the top

🖱️ Logo / Name Interaction

Make the "Youssef Mohamed" name (top-left) clickable

On click:

Smoothly scroll back to the Home / Hero section

Cursor pointer + subtle hover effect (color or underline)

🏠 Home Section – Credibility Boost (Minimal)

Under the main introduction text, add ONE short credibility line

Keep it subtle, professional, and calm

Example:

Trusted by real-world bug bounty programs and security platforms.


No badges explosion

No icons spam

🧠 About Section – Security Mindset Line

At the end of the About section, add one final sentence that shows security thinking

Example:

My approach focuses on understanding systems deeply, modeling real attacker behavior,
and delivering actionable security insights.

🧰 Skills Section – Order Only

Keep all skills exactly the same

Only reorder categories to reflect real security workflow:

Web Application Security

Network & Systems

Tools & Environments

Programming

📁 Projects Section – Professional Touch

For each project card:

Add a small Severity badge

Critical / High / Medium

Add one short Key Takeaway line at the bottom

Example:

Key takeaway: Business logic flaws are often more dangerous than technical vulnerabilities.


Keep layout unchanged

📨 Contact Section – Security Flavor

Under the contact form, add a very small line:

PGP key available upon request.


Keep it subtle

🎥 Animations & Motion

Use very subtle animations only

Smooth transitions

No aggressive motion

The site should feel calm, confident, and premium

🧹 Final Rules

Do NOT break responsiveness

Do NOT introduce Tailwind v3 syntax

Do NOT add new libraries unless absolutely necessary

Preserve the existing design identity

Goal:
Deliver a polished, modern cybersecurity portfolio that feels confident, professional,
and recruiter-ready — without changing its soul.
