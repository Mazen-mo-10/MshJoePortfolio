Role:
You are a senior Frontend Engineer with strong UX sense and experience building professional cybersecurity portfolios.

Goal:
Build a clean, focused, and modern Cybersecurity Portfolio Website using React typeScript + Tailwind CSS v4.
The portfolio must highlight projects and skills clearly without distraction, while keeping a subtle hacker aesthetic.

🧩 Tech Stack (Strict)

React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS v4 ONLY (not v3)

No inline CSS

No deprecated Tailwind v3 syntax

Fully responsive (mobile-first)

Clean, maintainable component structure

🎨 Theme & Design System
Themes

Implement Light Mode & Dark Mode

Both themes must include Cyber Green as an accent color

Theme toggle must be smooth (with transition)

Color Palette (Example – feel free to fine-tune)

Primary Green: #00ff9c

Dark Background: #0b0f0e

Light Background: #f8faf9

Text Dark: #0f172a

Text Light: #e5e7eb

Secondary Green (soft): #00c97a

Use colors subtly — no aggressive neon.
